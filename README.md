# Analyzing_the_user_database
This project involves analyzing a Customer-to-Customer (C2C) e-commerce platform's user database using MySQL, exploring user behavior, and deriving valuable insights to understand the business perspective.
This business model analysis involves working with a Customer-to-Customer (C2C) e-commerce platform's user database stored in a CSV file. The dataset contains information about users, their activities, and preferences. The goal is to analyze user behavior, understand business perspectives, and gather insights from the data.

Tasks to be performed include:
1. Creating a new schema "ecommerce."
2. Importing the CSV file "users_data" into MySQL.
3. Running SQL commands to explore the table structure and select the first 100 rows of the database.
4. Determining the number of distinct values for the "country" and "language" fields.
5. Analyzing whether male or female users have more followers.
6. Calculating the total number of users who use profile pictures, applications for the platform, Android app, and iOS app.
7. Calculating the total number of buyers for each country and sorting the result in descending order.
8. Calculating the total number of sellers for each country and sorting the result in ascending order.
9. Identifying the top 10 countries with the maximum product pass rate.
10. Analyzing the number of users on the platform for different language choices.
11. Examining the choices of female users regarding wishlisting or socially liking products on the platform.
12. Analyzing the choices of male users regarding being a seller or buyer on the platform.
13. Determining the country with the maximum number of buyers.
14. Listing the names of 10 countries with zero sellers.
15. Displaying records of the top 110 users who have recently used the e-commerce platform.
16. Calculating the number of female users who have not logged in for the last 100 days.
17. Displaying the number of female users for each country on the platform.
18. Displaying the number of male users for each country on the platform.
19. Calculating the average number of products sold and bought by male users for each country on the platform.

This comprehensive analysis of the user database aims to provide valuable insights into user behavior, platform usage, and the business's performance. The SQL queries and data processing enable exploration of various aspects of the C2C e-commerce platform and contribute to informed decision-making and business strategy.
